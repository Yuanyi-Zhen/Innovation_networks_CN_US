# Innovation_networks_CN_US

## Overview

The **Innovation_networks_CN_US** project is an open-source implementation of the code from the article *Hierarchical Innovation Networks in China Yield More Mobility, but Less Diversity than in the U.S.* This project aims to investigate and model the differences in social network structures between China and the U.S. by constructing ideal types of social structures: *clan-like* structures for China and *club-like* structures for the U.S. 

Using fractal theory, the project extends these micro-level structures to macro-network models, enabling a comparison of the macro-social network structures between the two countries. The results are validated with empirical data from three domains:
- **Scientific Collaboration Networks**: Relationships between academic authors.
- **Patent Inventor Collaboration Networks**: Connections among patent inventors.
- **Cultural Collaboration Networks**: Collaborations among film writers, directors, and stars.

The project also explores the creation and reproduction of social opportunities and the evolution of ideas and artifacts through temporal social networks and large language models.
